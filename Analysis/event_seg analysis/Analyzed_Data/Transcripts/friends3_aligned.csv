2.557,3.458," Guys, hurry up."
3.498,4.699,The flight leaves in four hours.
4.719,5.899,They could take time to get a taxi.
5.919,6.68,There could be traffic.
6.94,7.841,The plane could leave early.
7.861,9.762,"When we get to London, there could be a line of customs."
9.822,12.644,Come on!
12.664,13.685,Six-hour trip to London.
14.545,15.506,That's a lot of Monica.
17.768,21.89,"Passport check, camera check, traveler's checks check."
22.211,23.772,What are you saying check to?
24.432,26.354,"Myself, you know, for remembering to pack the thing."
26.914,28.495,"Now you do a good thing, you get a check."
31.874,32.474, My mom does it.
32.895,33.915,I never realized it was weird.
34.175,35.656,"Hey, my mom used to put her head in the oven."
37.717,39.198,I asked if she only did it the one time.
39.718,40.778,But it's pretty weird.
43.74,44.08,Hey.
44.4,44.8,Hey.
44.9,45.321,Hey.
45.661,46.101,Are you ready?
46.121,47.121,"Yep, you got the tickets?"
47.141,48.122,"Oh, got them right here."
48.382,48.622,Check.
51.424,52.904,"It's all London, baby."
53.445,54.065,Here we go.
57.326,58.167,You got your passport?
59.406,60.447, My third drawer in my dresser.
60.467,62.708,You don't want to lose that.
66.95,67.591,"Oh, there it is."
118.325,121.227," Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side."
121.587,123.549,The garbage bags are next to the refrigerator.
123.649,125.15,"Okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too."
125.19,126.451,Can I just ask her this stuff?
127.191,127.772,"Yeah, okay."
128.012,128.752,Give that a try.
130.854,131.874,"All right, let's do it."
131.954,133.195,"Yeah, cheerio."
133.275,134.216,"London, baby."
134.236,136.638,"Okay, because that's not gonna get annoying."
136.838,137.898,"London, baby!"
140.18,140.6,You know what?
140.72,141.301,I was wrong.
142.441,143.222," Well, we're all here."
143.242,144.663,I guess we should get going.
144.683,149.907,"Oh, I want to come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I can't get up."
150.307,151.288,"Oh, I'll come hug you."
151.308,151.688,"Great, yeah."
151.708,152.689,Can you bring me the newspaper?
152.709,156.392,That was great.
156.652,157.653,Thanks.
158.274,159.695,"Hey, Chandler, I want to hug you too."
159.795,160.135,Hey.
160.435,161.016,"Oh, and great."
161.056,162.137,You might as well bring me my book.
162.177,165.539,It's on the counter in your apartment.
165.68,166.06,Come on.
169.246,170.347, So we're off.
170.567,171.368,Have fun.
171.428,171.868,Thanks.
172.849,173.069,Oh.
173.77,175.992,I can't believe you're not going to be there.
176.232,176.813,"Oh, I know."
177.093,178.574,So come.
178.614,179.355,Why don't you come?
179.435,179.795,What?
179.895,180.456,To London.
180.576,181.256,Come to London.
181.376,181.817,Please.
181.897,183.178,It means so much to me.
183.198,183.278,Yeah.
183.338,184.679,I've got to work.
184.739,185.42,I'm sorry.
185.52,187.522,"Oh, why can't you take a couple of days off?"
187.602,188.883,"Because I can't, Rosie."
188.943,189.463,I told you.
189.543,190.084,"No, I can't."
190.985,191.745,This is my wedding.
191.765,193.267,All right.
193.287,193.587,You know what?
193.647,194.428,Now we really are late.
194.448,194.788,Let's go.
194.808,195.128,Let's go.
195.148,195.549,Let's go.
198.919,201.12," Fine, you're watching on video when we get back."
202.92,203.84,"Here you go, Phoebe."
203.94,204.801,"Here you go, Phobo."
204.941,206.261,"Phoobla, baby boo."
206.441,210.322,Thank you.
210.362,210.542,You.
210.622,213.543,"All right, let's go."
214.003,214.523,"Bye, Phoebe."
214.583,215.524,"Bye, Phoebe."
215.544,216.204,"Bye, Phoebe."
217.044,218.624,Goodbye.
218.744,220.005,Goodbye.
220.085,220.345,Bye.
220.385,221.585,"Love you, baby."
221.605,227.687,"Oh, do you need a hug?"
229.428,230.389, You don't have to bring me anything.
236.853,248.642,"Alright, Chandler, do something."
251.324,252.325,"Come on, do something."
252.625,253.025,I am.
253.145,253.826,I'm ignoring you.
255.384,255.804," Okay, here."
255.984,257.104,I'm gonna be the on-camera guy.
257.525,257.905,All right.
258.705,261.386,"First stop, Westminster Abbey."
263.706,264.666,"Oh, what the hell is that?"
264.766,265.627,"That's London, baby."
265.747,267.327,All right.
267.727,268.567,The hotel's here.
269.268,269.448,Wait.
270.628,271.448,"No, we wanna go."
271.468,271.508,No.
275.829,276.129,I know.
277.83,278.75,I'm gonna have to go into the map.
285.322,287.383," Okay, if you see a little version of me in there, kill it."
288.963,289.243,I got it.
291.224,291.664,Here we go.
294.525,297.786,"Okay, listen, listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time, are we?"
297.806,301.768,"Oh man, you made me lose it."
308.57,309.951, That was all before 10 o'clock.
310.191,313.534,The caterer rang to say it's going to be chicken Kiev instead of chicken Tarragon.
313.714,315.996,And then the florist phoned to say that there aren't any tulips.
316.096,318.418,"Oh, and then the chair list has cobbled tunnels since then."
318.438,319.519,"We're not going to be... Whoa, whoa, whoa."
319.539,320.72,"Emily, honey, OK?"
321.261,322.382,"Well, up yours too."
322.402,323.863,Up yours?
324.023,324.383,No.
324.664,326.385,"No, that's time out."
326.565,327.106,Sorry.
327.146,328.347,"Sweetie, you've got to relax."
328.407,330.188,"Everything's going to be great, OK?"
331.149,331.99,"Come on, come on."
335.831,336.371, Chicken Kiev?
336.391,337.352,Mm-hmm.
337.612,339.534,Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
340.574,344.757,"No, but something like salmon would just... it would be so much more elegant than chicken."
345.378,347.199,And you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.
350.221,352.143,So I can't wait to see where you're getting married.
352.303,353.484,"Yes, yes, yes."
353.524,355.085,This place is beautiful.
355.105,356.546,Emily's parents got married here.
356.566,358.667,I still can't believe they're tearing it down.
358.687,360.989,It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see.
361.009,361.87,"I mean, it's over..."
366.371,367.391," Oh, my God."
368.932,369.412,It's nice.
371.173,371.273,Oh!
372.013,372.113,Oh!
379.335,379.475,Oh!
380.175,381.456,"Oh, my God!"
382.216,383.196,How can this be happening?
383.236,384.136,What are we going to do?
384.657,385.257,It's all right.
385.277,386.557,Everything's going to be all right.
386.777,387.878,How is it going to be all right?
388.078,388.338,Uh-huh.
388.398,388.878,I see that.
388.898,391.219,OK.
391.579,392.779,I talked to the guy who was shoveling.
392.799,393.799,I found out what happened.
393.839,394.18,What?
394.2,394.32,What?
394.34,395.4,They tore it down a few days early.
400.253,401.054, All right.
402.294,403.515,Westminster Abbey.
403.535,405.136,Hands down.
405.437,406.497,Best Abbey I ever seen.
408.058,408.198,Hey.
409.72,410.04,Okay.
410.82,412.321,What do you think of the Abbey camera?
414.203,414.823,I think it's great.
415.023,415.283,It's great.
415.303,417.004,You know they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
417.445,417.665,Really?
417.685,417.965,What?
418.205,419.526,To put the camera away.
421.788,423.429,"Man, you are Westminster Crabby."
433.613,434.974, What do you need?
435.014,435.655,"Oh, nothing."
435.835,437.576,"Come on, I'm here to take care of you."
437.636,438.057,What do you need?
438.097,438.397,Anything?
439.157,440.098,"Okay, I have a wedgie."
443.821,444.922,"Okay, that is all you."
448.745,449.826,"So, what do you want for lunch?"
450.466,451.447,"Oh, I don't know."
452.708,454.149,I guess we have to eat.
454.169,454.91,"Yeah, I do."
456.951,457.752,What's the matter?
459.729,461.09, the way I left things with Ross.
461.11,463.812,I shouldn't lie to him about having to work.
464.352,465.413,He seems so mad at me.
465.433,467.654,"Yeah, don't be so hard on yourself."
468.254,469.995,Someone I was still in love with was getting married.
470.015,470.756,Still in love with?
471.496,471.776,Yeah.
473.057,474.118,I'm not in love with Ross.
475.358,475.538,Oh.
478.26,478.52,No.
478.92,479.1,No.
479.201,479.441,Good.
480.521,481.242,Don't get me neither.
483.063,488.006,"Baby, I'm not going to Ross's wedding because he's my ex-boyfriend, and that would be really uncomfortable."
489.039,490.62, Not because I'm still in love with him.
490.64,493.463,"I mean, hey, you know, I like Ross as much as the next guy."
493.483,497.106,"You know, clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love."
497.126,500.089,"You know, I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross, you know."
501.15,501.41,Yeah!
503.672,509.057,"But I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that I'm still in love with him, you know?"
509.097,512.58,"I mean, I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him."
512.6,516.003,"Oh, my God."
518.135,519.556, Why didn't you tell me?
521.837,523.017,We thought you knew.
523.137,523.437,We?
523.738,524.598,"Yeah, we all know."
524.638,525.918,We talk about it all the time.
528.68,529.68,You all know?
529.72,530.28,Does Ross know?
530.861,531.361,"Oh, no."
531.461,532.501,Ross doesn't know anything.
533.942,535.683,"Oh, I can't believe you didn't tell me."
535.703,537.243,Because we thought you knew.
537.304,538.604,It's so obvious.
538.984,539.384,Got it.
539.825,543.586,"It would be like, you know, telling Monica, hey, you know, you like things clean."
549.207,551.508, So what do you find gentlemen in the market for?
551.568,554.209,"We got scarves, souvenir postcards."
554.789,556.069,"Check this out, huh?"
557.449,559.53,That's the stuff.
560.33,560.77,What do you think?
561.331,562.471,"Well, I'm not going to have to buy that."
562.571,564.091,I'm with stupid t-shirt anymore.
564.111,569.893,"All right, look, you're not really going to buy that, are you?"
569.913,571.774,Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
571.794,573.154,"Oh, I embarrass you?"
573.794,575.735,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
577.779,578.499, He's just jealous.
578.519,579.34,You'll fit right in.
579.38,580.341,All Londoners wear them.
580.661,581.001,"Oh, really?"
581.341,583.663,Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?
585.264,586.124,They're all tourists.
586.905,593.949,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that in public, you know, you're going to spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
595.53,602.995,You're going to make me choose between you and the hat?
603.575,604.396,I choose the hat.
604.596,605.116,Good choice.
605.457,605.637,Thanks.
605.677,605.897,"OK, look."
606.86,607.563," Alright, that's it."
607.724,608.487,"Okay, I'm out of here."
608.547,610.214,I'm not going to be embarrassed anymore.
621.862,624.283," Hey, I just spoke to your dad and you know what?"
624.823,627.163,He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
627.483,628.164,We don't have to.
628.184,629.144,"Oh, what?"
629.184,629.864,You found a place?
630.364,639.927,"No, but Monica and I were talking and I was so upset about the whole being knocked down and she suggested that we just put the wedding off for a bit."
643.968,644.568,She said what?
644.768,649.569,"She said, if I'm not going to be happy getting married somewhere that we can find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
653.234,653.814, postpone it.
655.795,660.297,"Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent on this wedding?"
660.997,670.382,Do you think my sister's teeny tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here?
675.144,675.844,This isn't right.
677.498,680.1, I realize that people are going to be disappointed.
680.381,682.843,But I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
683.063,684.885,"Well, I can't ask people to do that."
684.985,686.346,Would you ask people to do that?
686.366,688.508,Don't you point your pants at me.
690.77,691.691,We have no choice.
692.712,694.994,Anywhere that's half decent will have been booked months ago.
695.034,695.935,"Ross, don't you understand?"
695.955,697.836,This is our wedding I'm talking about.
697.856,701.219,The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option.
701.279,702.781,This is when we're getting married.
703.083,704.624," So what are you saying, it's now or never?"
704.844,706.065,"No, I'm saying it's now."
706.345,706.485,Or?
706.765,708.186,There's no or in mine.
708.926,712.708,What is wrong with these pants?
713.469,715.65,"It's not the pants, it's you who's backwards."
716.15,721.193,"And if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't be getting married at all."
721.213,723.134,"Emily, no, wait, stop."
723.214,723.695,"Emily, please."
736.387,738.949, So did shopping help you feel any better about Ross?
739.369,741.031,Manhattan does not have enough stores.
743.612,745.854,"Well, I think I can help you get over him."
746.294,746.775,You can?
747.075,747.315,Yeah.
747.715,755.301,I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross and a small piece of chocolate and a glass of tepid water.
755.701,761.685,"Oh, is this one of those things where you prove I'm just open a bed with some graveyard dirt and then hang it from a north-facing tree?"
762.566,763.967,"Only if you have the hiccups, too."
767.108,769.449," Yeah, the pictures are for you, the chocolate and the waters for me."
769.469,770.469,I just didn't feel like getting up.
770.99,775.551,"Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross, okay?"
775.971,779.113,"And you're going to remember all the bad things about him, all right?"
779.193,781.053,Really focus on his flaws.
781.233,781.714,I can do that.
782.074,783.474,Certainly did that while we were going out.
784.815,785.555,Okay.
786.195,789.597,"Before we get started, I just want to say for the record that I love Ross."
789.637,790.717,I think he's such a great guy.
796.277,802.279," Okay, now, close your eyes, and imagine that you're with Ross, okay?"
802.339,815.704,"And imagine that you're kissing him, and you're running your hands all over his body, and then you run your hands through his hair, but oh, gross, it's some kind of grace, it's gross!"
816.004,818.104,Huh?
818.705,819.405,I don't know.
820.645,822.806,His hair never bothered me that much.
823.346,825.787,"You know, it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
827.54,827.76, Okay.
827.82,829.881,It's gonna be harder than I thought.
830.441,833.322,"Um, let's try some, um, aversion therapy."
833.522,833.682,Okay.
833.702,834.042,Okay.
834.202,834.602,All right.
834.702,836.003,"So, um, yeah, look at the picture."
836.023,836.283,Okay.
836.323,836.903,All right.
837.123,840.845,"And, um... Ow!"
841.025,845.566,Okay.
845.606,846.266,How do you feel now?
847.007,848.807,"Well, I like you less."
860.529,862.771, Hey.
864.312,864.592,Hey.
869.096,869.216,Oh.
869.897,870.337,Sorry.
870.357,871.718,"No, no."
871.738,872.158,You know what?
872.238,872.799,I'm sorry.
872.819,875.221,I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me.
875.241,876.462,"I mean, that really wasn't cool."
876.802,880.385,"And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day."
882.407,882.787,Me too.
884.068,884.288,Yeah?
884.808,885.049,No!
887.284,888.545, I had the best day ever.
888.565,891.346,"Dude, check this out."
893.967,894.267,Hey.
894.287,894.767,"Shh, shh, shh, shh."
897.048,899.069,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him you like my hat."
899.45,900.99,"Okay, so, um, what's your friend's name?"
901.03,901.971,"Oh, Chandler."
902.871,903.732,"Hi, Chandler."
903.792,906.393,"Oh, that was... Oh, my God."
906.453,909.214,"It's Bergen, baby!"
909.814,913.156,"Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kind of dashing."
915.114,915.454, What did you?
915.895,915.955,How?
915.975,918.876,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?"
919.077,922.299,"So, I'm in my map, and... Hey."
923.139,923.399,Hey.
923.459,923.719,Hey.
924.8,926.921,I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
927.982,928.723,"Yes, I did."
928.743,931.224,And you are welcome.
933.686,934.286,Am I?
936.407,938.409,And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
941.07,942.992,Um... I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
943.132,943.412,Wait up!
946.514,949.935," Hey, since you're the fix-it lady, here's a pickle."
950.836,954.837,What do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
955.758,956.558,She said that?
956.878,957.138,Yeah.
957.658,958.079,Why?
958.099,958.939,I don't know.
958.959,963.921,"I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she, like, flipped out."
965.362,966.022,"Oh, my God."
966.862,968.263,You're even dumber than I am.
968.283,970.384,Excuse me?
972.004,973.705,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
975.27,976.131," I don't know, a month?"
976.551,979.112,Emily has probably been planning it since she was five.
980.073,983.155,Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head.
983.175,986.496,That's what we did.
987.597,989.558,We dreamed about the perfect wedding.
989.578,992.18,And the perfect place.
993.961,995.802,With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.
998.263,999.464,With the little people on top.
1009.246,1017.771, But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
1017.791,1021.793,I had no idea.
1021.813,1027.736,"And that, that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun."
1030.418,1031.198,Sometimes we were.
1031.218,1034.56,Come on.
1034.62,1038.142,"You gotta help me figure out what to do, okay?"
1048.228,1051.371, I hope Ross didn't think we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here.
1059.178,1059.979,I hope he did.
1068.254,1068.614, Hello?
1069.054,1069.655,"Hey, Phoebes."
1069.735,1070.215,It's Joey.
1070.595,1071.376,"Hey, Joey!"
1071.396,1072.036,Hey!
1072.176,1072.356,Oh!
1072.776,1072.916,Oh!
1073.217,1078.899,"I just saw someone that looks just like you on the subway, and I was gonna go over and say hi, but then I figured he doesn't care."
1078.919,1079.54,He looks like you.
1082.261,1083.442,That just cost me four bucks.
1085.343,1088.164,"But, uh, listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing."
1088.444,1088.544,Oh!
1088.604,1090.505,They're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe.
1090.906,1092.386,Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.
1094.387,1095.368,"So, do you miss me?"
1096.695,1098.276, But I've just been having way too much fun.
1099.037,1100.178,"Oh, so you're not homesick yet?"
1101.098,1101.399,No.
1102.039,1102.86,I don't think so.
1102.88,1105.982,"All right, well, the seven of us miss you."
1110.324,1110.885,Who's seven?
1111.145,1113.507,"You know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies."
1114.347,1115.608,"Oh, the babies miss me."
1118.11,1119.23,"Oh, pizza guy's here."
1119.851,1121.172,You ordered pizza without me?
1122.853,1124.634," Yeah, but, you know, we were thinking about you."
1124.794,1126.175,"You know, we ordered the Joey special."
1126.636,1127.516,Joe pizzas?
1129.477,1129.738,Yeah?
1130.278,1131.158,"Okay, gotta go."
1131.178,1131.879,Talk to you later.
1132.259,1133.52,"Wait, wait, where did you get it from?"
1133.6,1133.62,I...
1156.286,1166.812," Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?"
1166.872,1167.672,You'll see.
1168.753,1170.354,"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
1175.126,1183.772," Okay, but imagine a lot more lights, okay, and, you know, fewer bricks, and flowers, and candles."
1184.112,1190.116,"And the musicians, they can go over here, okay, and the chairs, they can face this way, and you go."
1192.018,1197.401,"But if you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place, any other time, really, it's fine."
1198.122,1199.103,Whatever you want.
1201.364,1202.325,It's perfect.
1203.542,1205.545, And I don't know if it starts to rain.
1205.565,1206.467,Well then we'll get wet.
1206.487,1206.547,Aww.
1208.129,1214.74,I don't even have a date.
1218.047,1219.069," Babes, yeah?"
1219.369,1220.951,Do you remember where the duck food is?
1221.151,1223.715,"Yeah, it's in the guy's apartment under the sink."
1224.035,1224.256,Why?
1224.276,1225.738,Because I'm going to London.
1225.758,1225.838,What?
1226.439,1228.982,What do you mean you're going to London?
1229.202,1231.005,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him."
1231.245,1233.708,"Now, honey, you take care and you don't have those babies till I get back."
1235.683,1236.663," Rachel, you can't go."
1236.763,1237.724,Ross loves Emily.
1237.844,1238.144,I know.
1238.204,1238.464,I know.
1238.524,1239.144,I know he doesn't.
1239.204,1241.085,But I have to tell him how I feel.
1241.185,1244.926,"He deserves to have all of the information, and then he can make an informed decision."
1244.946,1246.826,So how you're going?
1246.866,1250.227,"You're going because you hope he's gonna say, yeah, I love you too, Rach."
1250.387,1251.708,Forget about that British chippy.
1251.728,1255.069,Do you think he will?
1255.649,1258.67,"No, because he's in love with the British chippy."
1261.008,1264.389," Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding."
1264.97,1266.17,"You know, it's too late."
1266.23,1267.251,You missed your chance.
1268.591,1269.111,I'm sorry.
1269.191,1270.532,I know this must be really hard.
1270.552,1273.033,But it's over.
1277.715,1278.075,You know what?
1278.155,1278.335,No.
1278.515,1280.196,"It's not over until someone says, I do."
1280.276,1280.596,I do!
1281.936,1282.297,I do!
1283.097,1283.417,I do!
1283.537,1283.877,I do!
1283.897,1283.937,Oh.
1290.851,1291.777, I can really chase you.
1291.817,1292.683,I'm carrying a litter.
