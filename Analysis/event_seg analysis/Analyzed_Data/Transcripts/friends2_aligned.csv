7.406,9.567, The tenth time I've peed since I've been here.
9.587,11.848,It's also like the tenth time you've told us.
12.929,15.15,"Yeah, oh, I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear."
15.17,20.273,"I'll tell you, it's a lot easier having three babies playing bring it into noise, bring it into funk on your bladder."
22.975,24.736,So sick of being pregnant.
25.216,29.598,"The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, because, oh, I'm pregnant."
29.678,34.661,"Phoebes, you want a cookie?"
37.25,38.051, He's so red.
40.792,43.834,"So, uh, Thebes, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"
45.716,46.796,I haven't really had any yet.
100.967,101.087, Hey.
101.127,101.387,Hey.
102.048,102.408,All right.
103.529,104.189,Here's the ring.
105.33,105.59,Yes.
106.091,107.532,"Yes, a thousand times yes."
109.773,112.115,"So, uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
112.475,113.036,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
113.116,118.22,"Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man's gonna be?"
119.701,120.321,"Oh, it's awkward."
120.481,120.901,It's awkward.
120.922,121.342,It's awkward.
124.124,125.445,Sort of already asked Chandler.
126.656,126.956, What?
127.457,128.918,He got to do it at your first wedding.
129.198,130.88,"Joey, I figured you'd understand."
130.96,132.561,"I mean, I've known him a lot longer."
132.701,133.562,"Come on, Ross."
133.582,134.843,"Look, I don't have any brothers."
134.903,136.624,I'm never going to get to be a best man.
136.805,138.626,You can be the best man when I get married.
139.987,142.569,I'm never going to get to be a best man.
142.589,144.531,"Wait, wait."
144.551,148.915,"So you get to be my best man twice, and I don't get to be yours at all?"
150.496,150.776,"Oh, no."
151.457,153.639,Of course you can be my best man.
158.08,158.72, What about me?
158.74,159.821,You just said I could.
160.081,161.001,I'm not even getting married.
162.081,164.562,"Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers."
165.462,167.043,I can't believe you're not picking me.
167.203,168.703,"Hey, how could it not be me?"
168.763,171.164,"I'm not even... I don't even... All right, you know what?"
171.484,172.164,That's it.
172.444,175.225,"From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man."
175.965,176.305,Yes!
177.046,177.966,"Shame about you, though."
183.857,184.357, Stop it?
185.318,185.498,What?
186.319,187.46,One of the babies is kicking.
188.441,189.281,I thought that was a good thing.
189.742,191.903,"It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies."
191.923,195.666,"Oh, don't make me come in there!"
195.886,198.568,Hey!
199.129,199.209,Hey.
199.249,201.571,Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
201.931,203.052,"Yeah, there's one right out of the cabinet."
204.233,204.713,"Oh, thanks."
204.893,205.333,Why do you need it?
205.353,207.095,"Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night."
207.155,207.375,Later.
207.695,208.136,"Oh, hey!"
208.296,210.537,You planning on inviting us?
211.078,212.299,"No, later."
213.746,215.687," Get your ass back here, Tribionni!"
216.748,220.71,Hormones.
222.551,225.553,"What Phoebe meant to say was, um, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?"
225.573,228.715,"Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party."
228.735,228.775,So?
229.436,230.156,Are you bachelors?
231.897,232.197,No.
232.658,233.418,Are you strippers?
235.88,236.34,No.
236.86,237.601,Then you're not invited?
238.976,239.557," All right, fine."
239.577,241.998,"You're not invited to, uh, the party that we're gonna have, either."
242.639,243.58,"Oh, well, what party?"
245.641,249.464,"Well, um... The baby shower for Phoebe?"
249.945,250.765,Baby shower?
250.945,253.588,"Wow, that so doesn't sound like something I want to do later."
253.608,258.892,I can't believe I'm gonna have a party!
260.473,261.574,So great!
261.674,262.274,A party!
262.294,262.895,Yay!
274.309,276.629," This is what I got going for the party so far, liquor-wise."
277.71,278.47,Get a lot of liquor.
278.83,280.45,"Great, great."
280.55,287.691,"Okay, now, in terms of the invite list, obviously I got you, me, and Chandler, and I'm gonna invite Gunther because, well, we've been talking about this pretty loudly."
288.192,288.592,I'll be there.
289.372,295.693,"All right, and now, oh, listen, I know it's your party, but I'd really like to limit the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
295.873,299.234,"Yeah, tell you what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, okay?"
299.294,301.114,Just the dinosaur dudes.
304.411,306.652," Okay, we need a six pack of Zima."
309.052,309.973,"Hey, guys, what are you doing?"
311.053,314.394,"Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man."
315.254,317.495,"Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one."
317.935,322.856,"Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna be that difficult considering this one won't take place in the basement of a pizza hut."
324.997,325.637,"Well, I'm Ross."
325.697,326.117,I'm Ross.
326.157,327.018,I'm too good for the hut.
327.078,327.798,I'm too good for the hut.
330.131,331.292," Look, I gotta go pick up Ben."
331.652,333.593,"Everything so far sounds great, Joey."
333.613,335.474,"Just remember, keep it on the mellow side, okay?"
335.494,337.514,Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker.
337.575,339.555,"No, no strippers or anything, okay?"
339.756,340.296,You got it.
340.376,341.516,"Okay, see you later."
343.537,346.279,Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
346.299,349.06,I thought it was gonna be strippers there.
349.22,350.821,You didn't say anything about no strippers.
351.801,355.683,He just said no strippers.
356.283,356.403,Oh.
356.784,357.624,I chose not to hear that.
360.077,361.917," Look what I got, look what I got, look what I got."
365.138,365.278,Oh.
367.579,369.339,Can you believe they made these for little people?
370.479,371.399,Little village people.
371.419,375.02,"Oh, okay."
375.8,376.62,Look at this one.
376.86,378.481,This is my favorite.
379.721,382.102,"Oh, that is so sweet."
382.162,384.082,Baby's gonna love dressing them in these.
385.56,385.8, Huh.
386.501,390.284,"Except, uh, Phoebe's not gonna be the one who gets to dress them."
392.526,394.568,Because she's not going to get to keep the babies.
395.249,396.43,"Oh, my God!"
396.49,399.293,We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
400.646,401.006, Wait a minute.
401.407,405.449,Unless we give her all gifts that she can use after she's done being pregnant.
405.849,407.03,Like regular coffee.
407.391,407.851,Tequila.
408.091,411.193,"Oh, and somebody can get her those leather pants that she's always wanted."
411.313,412.654,"Oh, she's gonna love that."
413.114,414.115,What the hell is this?
416.056,418.498,What did you actually thought it would make me feel better?
418.758,421.66,To give me something I can't even use for another two months?
422.441,423.341,This sucks!
423.801,428.124,"All right, what's my next present?"
428.745,429.305,Everything!
430.806,433.908," Hey, listen, man, about the stripper."
434.789,435.029,Yeah?
435.369,436.27,Good call.
436.39,438.031,Okay.
438.131,439.532,A little announcement.
439.552,440.272,A little announcement.
441.673,445.536,"I have decided that my best man is my best friend, Gunther."
448.297,449.598,What's my last name?
451.8,452.64,Central Perk.
455.342,456.463,Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
456.903,459.865,"Hey, well, hey, Gunther, don't forget your shirt."
461.718,463.039," Hey, hey, what are those?"
463.059,464.86,"Have a little party favorites, check it out."
466.321,466.922,"Wow, yeah."
467.042,469.283,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
471.945,472.125,Aw.
472.165,473.606,"Nick, okay, little announcement."
473.626,477.209,I just want everybody to know that the position of my best man is still open.
478.51,481.592,"And, uh, you know, so is the position of the bride down."
483.553,484.053,Great.
485.574,486.115,"Smooth, man."
486.415,487.616,"Yeah, you got some chili on your neck."
492.315,494.776," Well, I just want to say thanks, everyone."
494.816,496.316,"This was great, okay?"
496.376,498.437,"And hey, I'll see you guys Monday morning."
501.278,501.838,Thanks.
502.118,503.118,"Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt."
503.458,506.979,"Oh, man."
507.939,508.38,Okay.
508.42,509.84,"Hey, museum geeks."
510.42,511.08,Party's over.
511.28,511.72,Okay.
511.821,513.521,"Wave bye-bye, you're a nice lady."
513.601,514.201,There you go.
514.821,516.282,Back to your parents' basement.
516.522,516.802,All right.
521.015,522.376," Come on, boys, come on out."
522.456,523.936,There you go.
525.157,526.858,"Oh, look at the little birdies."
526.878,528.139,Are those yours?
528.179,528.399,Yeah.
528.899,531.72,"Well, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets."
532.081,532.761,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
532.821,535.002,"And I got the duck totally trained, too, what says."
535.943,536.543,Stare at the wall.
538.844,539.444,Hardly move.
541.906,542.246,Be white.
545.279,547.441, You are really good at that.
548.482,549.583,"So, I had fun tonight."
550.183,551.845,You throw one hell of a party.
551.965,552.966,"Well, thanks, thanks."
552.986,553.886,"Yeah, it was great meeting you."
554.146,560.632,"And listen, if any of my friends ever get married or, you know, have a birthday or a Tuesday... Yeah, they'll be great."
562.654,564.855,"So, I guess, um, goodnight."
565.296,568.619,"Well, unless you, uh... unless you want to hang around."
569.74,569.98,Yeah?
570.64,570.84,Yeah.
571.541,572.462,I'll let you play with my duck.
585.396,585.896, Hey.
589.498,590.019,Stripper.
605.388,606.909,The stripper stole the ring!
607.389,608.99,"The stripper stole the ring, Taylor!"
609.01,609.69,"Get up, get up!"
609.731,610.991,The stripper stole the ring!
612.332,612.512,What?
612.852,613.733,The ring is gone!
615.839,618.401," It's like, give me a minute to wake up for this."
619.562,621.804,Ah!
622.024,622.845,You lost the ring.
623.045,624.586,You're the worst best man ever.
624.606,627.008,"Dude, this isn't funny."
627.389,628.149,What am I gonna do?
628.409,629.45,I go to sleep last night.
629.67,630.351,Everything's cool.
630.391,631.332,I wake up this morning.
631.352,633.414,The stripper's gone and the ring is gone.
633.634,634.675,You slept with the stripper?
634.835,635.395,Of course.
635.415,639.038,"Hi, guys."
639.098,640.359,"Hi, Phoebe."
640.58,640.9,"Hi, Phoebe."
643.001,648.545," I wanted to apologize if I, you know, seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower."
648.565,651.227,"You know, it's just hormones, you know?"
651.247,651.967,I know.
652.007,652.268,Weak.
652.388,653.168,Hormones.
653.208,653.869,Yeah.
654.329,655.89,"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you."
655.91,657.311,"It was just, it was so sweet."
657.331,657.651,Whoa.
657.811,658.252,Okay.
658.492,658.932,So sweet.
658.972,659.432,Thank you.
662.409,662.829, Yeah.
663.029,663.309,Wow.
663.349,664.89,You seem to be doing so much better.
664.91,665.51,That's great.
666.571,667.291,How are things going?
667.831,668.091,Good.
668.372,671.953,"You know, no, but, OK, it feels like everything's been about me lately."
672.013,673.534,So what's happening with you?
673.554,678.336,"Oh, well, actually, we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding."
678.536,678.656,Oh.
678.896,682.798,And this might be too hard given the history and all that.
682.918,683.138,Wow.
683.338,690.061,This reminds me of the time when I was living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
694.465,695.586," Well, how is this like that?"
696.046,697.347,"Well, let's see."
697.407,697.787,It's not.
698.507,699.728,Really.
699.948,702.549,"Like that because you see, that was an actual problem."
703.189,709.933,"And yours is just like, you know, a bunch of, you know, high school crap that nobody really gives to anybody."
714.675,715.615,"Well, I'm sorry."
715.675,718.156,"I guess I just thought that, you know... All right, here come the waterworks."
721.041,722.442, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
722.782,725.003,I called the company that sat there and they don't care.
725.383,727.364,Then I called 911 and they yelled at me.
727.584,729.185,"If this isn't an emergency, then what is?"
731.726,732.146,"Hey, guys."
732.746,732.906,Hey.
733.107,736.628,I just wanted to thank you again for last night.
736.828,738.009,What a great party.
738.109,739.81,And the guys from work had a blast.
739.99,746.733,"You know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before, and another one had never been to a party before."
749.235,751.577," So, hey, that wedding ring, huh?"
753.399,754.6,"Man, that is nice."
754.72,755.38,"Yeah, right?"
755.42,758.683,"Yeah, I was thinking I might pick one of those babies up for myself."
759.163,760.585,Where might one get one of those?
762.486,762.967,That ring?
764.128,769.712,"When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
773.175,776.258,She might say that the ring is irreplaceable.
778.561,779.101, Absolutely.
779.141,780.882,It's been in my family for generations.
781.522,785.144,And every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
785.664,788.366,So you might say it's a magic ring.
793.028,794.669,"Yeah, the strip is stolen."
798.128,798.608, My ring?
798.888,800.368,My wedding ring?
800.448,803.869,The stripper stole my wedding ring?
804.949,805.109,How?
805.349,806.269,How could this happen?
806.41,810.01,"Well, I think it all started when you said, hey, Joey, why don't you be my best man?"
813.111,814.091,"All right, all right, fine."
814.131,815.211,I'm going to call the cops.
816.091,817.071,"Dude, I screwed up."
817.111,818.272,You don't have to turn me in.
818.292,821.772,"Not on you, on the stripper."
822.072,822.452,"Oh, yeah."
822.472,823.452,"Well, I already did that."
823.813,826.313,They said they're going to look into it right after they solve all the murders.
828.106,830.487," Okay, well then we'll call the company that sent her."
830.727,831.507,I did that too.
831.627,833.467,They wouldn't give me a real name or her number.
834.067,835.968,"They said if I bothered them again, they'd call the police."
836.008,836.988,"I said, you talk to the police."
837.028,838.288,You tell them I'm missing a ring.
840.569,841.309,"So what, Joey?"
841.329,842.509,What are you telling me?
842.569,843.87,That there's nothing we can do?
844.21,845.13,How could this happen?
845.43,848.211,"Look, Ross, I am so, so sorry."
852.011,858.594," Well, what if we just called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?"
859.114,861.275,"Well, that sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!"
863.796,870.038,"Here's your tea, Phoebe."
876.721,876.981,Mmm.
878.442,878.962,So good.
880.217,880.857," Oh, thanks."
881.257,881.577,Sweet.
881.737,881.977,Good.
882.657,883.658,So glad you liked it.
885.118,885.898,"Oh, what?"
886.478,887.278,"What, she made the tea?"
889.959,892.399,"No, I think I just had a contraction."
892.579,892.959,You what?
893.239,893.719,"Oh, my God."
893.819,898.24,"Yeah, I thought I felt one a couple minutes ago, and now I know that definitely was one."
898.52,899.34,"Oh, wait."
899.38,900.321,You can't have the baby here.
900.341,902.541,"I mean, I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out."
902.561,902.601,OK.
902.641,903.661,It's OK.
903.701,904.401,We're going to be OK.
904.421,905.141,We're going to be OK.
905.221,905.581,It's OK.
905.662,907.962,I'm going to boil some water and just rip up some sheets.
909.913,910.133, Ow.
910.773,911.293,It's all right.
911.313,912.454,It's probably false labor.
912.474,914.294,They said that that could happen near the end.
914.354,915.934,So just somebody get the book.
916.154,916.874,"Rachel, get the book."
916.914,917.354,The book.
917.394,917.714,Okay.
918.135,918.415,Okay.
919.355,919.615,Here.
920.955,921.635,The Bible?
921.655,922.015,I don't know.
922.035,929.137,All right.
929.197,929.477,Okay.
929.617,929.797,Okay.
929.837,930.277,This is great.
931.257,932.477,"Chandler, you get behind the desk."
933.317,937.098,"And when she comes in, hopefully she won't recognize it because... Well, why would she?"
938.749,944.253," Okay, and then, uh, you buzz Ross and I, and you be, uh, Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be Mr. Wong."
946.814,949.016,Diverse.
949.896,951.858,Anybody call for security?
953.739,955.74,You be cool.
961.264,961.984,Okay.
962.305,964.086,Which one of you guys is Gunther Central for?
966.676,967.236," Hey, Joey."
967.576,968.337,Where's my ring?
968.377,969.857,My dead grandma's wedding ring.
969.877,970.257,Where is it?
970.297,970.797,Where is it?
971.257,974.038,"Way to be cool, man."
976.439,977.359,What's he talking about?
978.1,980.58,There was a ring in a box on my nightstand.
980.86,982.041,"After you left, it was gone."
982.061,982.841,Wait a minute.
982.861,984.541,You guys think I stole some ring?
984.561,985.402,Yeah.
987.282,990.423,"We know you took it, so just save yourself the time and confess."
990.703,990.963,OK.
991.163,991.544,Who were you?
991.564,992.384,The Hardy Boys?
996.26,998.382," Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right?"
998.422,1000.804,"I make $1,600 a week doing what I do."
1001.344,1002.305,Any of you guys make that?
1004.307,1004.687,Marry me.
1009.311,1009.811,Don't get it.
1009.831,1011.612,We's in my room all night.
1012.133,1016.036,"If she didn't take it, and I didn't take it, and you didn't take it, then who did?"
1016.056,1019.699,We're trying to think.
1034.735,1037.357, We still don't get how you know when it's false labor.
1037.697,1038.998,"Well, do you see any babies?"
1041.481,1042.121,How do you feel?
1042.461,1043.382,"OK, I guess."
1043.502,1046.264,"I mean, I don't know."
1047.465,1049.787,"I guess I know it's going to be over soon, so."
1050.868,1052.289,But isn't that a good thing?
1052.409,1054.932,"I mean, you said you were sick of this."
1056.393,1056.713,I know.
1056.733,1062.478,"It's just, you know, usually when you're done with the pregnant thing, then you get to do the mom thing."
1064.344,1068.626," I'm gonna be, you know, sitting around in my leather pants drinking tequila."
1071.728,1072.688,Some moms do that.
1074.929,1075.83,"Yeah, that's even sadder."
1077.751,1080.952,"Look, I know what I got myself into, you know."
1080.972,1088.136,"It's just that now that they're in me, it's like, it's like I know them, you know."
1091.215,1094.457," It's just not gonna be easy when, you know, these little babies have to go away."
1095.958,1096.799,"I know, sweetie."
1098.04,1099.721,But it's not like you're not gonna have anything.
1099.741,1101.843,"I mean, you're gonna have nieces and nephews."
1102.523,1103.684,"In some ways, that's even better."
1104.525,1105.085,"Yeah, okay."
1105.565,1106.426,"No, really."
1106.446,1107.947,Really.
1107.987,1118.114,"I mean, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college or yelling at them when they're bad, you know, or deciding to put them on Reddlin' when they just won't calm down."
1120.814,1125.655, You're going to be the one that they come to when they want to run away from home and the one they talk to about sex.
1126.015,1128.175,You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.
1130.676,1131.896,Cool Aunt Phoebe.
1133.476,1134.276,I am pretty cool.
1134.696,1134.836,Oh.
1136.357,1137.337,"Yeah, and you know what else?"
1137.897,1140.337,"Oh my God, are they going to love you?"
1141.738,1142.638,They are going to love me.
1142.858,1142.998,Oh.
1145.138,1145.918,"Thanks, you guys."
1146.398,1146.939,"Aw, honey."
1147.019,1147.419,Again?
1148.179,1148.959,"Aw, sweetie."
1151.277,1152.778," Oh, thanks."
1152.898,1153.538,"Oh, what?"
1153.798,1154.179,"Oh, God."
1154.399,1154.879,Just kidding.
1155.119,1157.58,"Ah, what?"
1157.66,1158.3,"Oh, my God."
1158.36,1159.141,"Oh, gotcha again."
1159.181,1161.461,You're so easy.
1164.503,1165.643,If anything should happen to him.
1165.683,1168.524,"Joey, the vet said it's a simple procedure."
1168.884,1169.184,So?
1169.445,1170.325,Things could go wrong.
1170.465,1170.965,You don't know.
1170.985,1172.626,"Well, what if he doesn't make it?"
1172.706,1173.506,"He will, Joe."
1173.526,1174.847,"Yeah, but what if he doesn't?"
1174.867,1177.808,He's such a good duck.
1217.654,1220.397," I'm so worried about him, you know?"
1220.677,1221.418,Somebody lose a ring?
1221.678,1221.838,Hey!
1222.198,1222.339,Oh!
1222.999,1223.8,Oh my God!
1224.401,1224.881,Thank you!
1224.941,1225.922,Thank you so much!
1230.525,1231.146, How's the doctor?
1231.166,1231.986,He's doing just fine.
1232.026,1233.748,"He's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit."
1233.928,1234.849,"Oh, great."
1235.529,1238.231,"Hey, listen, Ross, thanks for being so cool about this."
1238.391,1239.132,"No, that's all right."
1239.272,1240.113,"No, it's not."
1240.213,1243.855,"I mean, you made me your best man, and I totally let you down."
1243.875,1244.696,"Hey, come on."
1244.736,1245.477,It's not your fault.
1245.557,1246.177,"Yeah, it is."
1246.597,1248.439,"You wouldn't have lost the ring, right?"
1249.059,1249.58,You know what?
1250.801,1251.961,"Ross, you were right from the start."
1252.001,1253.022,He should be your best man.
1253.122,1254.163,"No, you should."
1254.223,1255.244,"Look, don't argue with me."
1255.344,1256.004,"Hey, hey, hey."
1256.365,1257.746,I get to choose my best man.
1259.884,1260.985, I want both of you guys.
1263.267,1263.767,Really?
1263.827,1264.148,Really?
1264.168,1267.911,"I mean, both of you guys should be up there with me."
1267.931,1278.079,"I mean, you two are like... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good... Okay, thanks, man."
1280.922,1282.223,"I gotta go check something, okay?"
1288.404,1288.924, What a baby.
1289.064,1289.665,Total worse.
1310.25,1310.37, Ah!
